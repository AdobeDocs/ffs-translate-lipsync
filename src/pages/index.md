# Adobe Dubbing and Lipsync (ADLS) Public Beta APIs

An overview of the APIs currently available in public beta
## Overview

Welcome to the Dubbing & Lipsync API documentation. This documentation will guide you through:

**Transcribe API:** Generate accurate transcriptions in source or target language with the ability to download and edit transcripts. Integrate seamlessly with other APIs for a streamlined workflow.

**Dub API:** Automate audio and video voice translation with optional lip-syncing, producing high-quality dubbing output regardless of background noise and music. Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) support ensures content protection against deep fakes.

**Lipsync API (included as a parameter in Dub):** Achieve precise lip-syncing with accurate lip composition on the speakerâ€™s mouth, and create high-quality composited lip-sync videos. Supports multi-speaker scenarios for an enhanced user experience.

Check out the [Getting Started Section](./guides/) to set up your project, obtain and authenticate your credentials, and build efficient workflows by chaining API calls across these endpoints. <br /> <br />
