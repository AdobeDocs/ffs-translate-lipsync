# Adobe Dubbing and Lip Sync (ADLS) APIs

Use ADLS to create audio or video dubs.

## Overview

The Dubbing and Lip Sync (ADLS) API uses transcriptions to generate audio and video with precise, accurate dubbing and composited lip sync. This feature supports multi-speaker scenarios.

Supported workflows include:

1. **Automated Dubbing** for audio and video.
2. **Dubbing with edited transcripts**.
3. **Dubbing with pre-existing translations**.

**Lip Sync** is also included as a parameter of the Dub API to create high-quality composited videos with precise lip-syncing.

[Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)](http://contentauthenticity.org/) support ensures protection against deepfakes.
